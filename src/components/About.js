    <h1>About CheckMyCode</h1>
    <p>This app was created by two beginning developers who had learned web development through online tutorials, mostly freeCodeCamp.<i class="fa fa-free-code-camp" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
    <p>The goal of this app is to make it easier for coders of all levels - especially beginners - to receive and give code reviews.</p>
    <p>Our plans with this app is to make it as easy as possible for people to post their code and to review other people's code.
      We also want to provide learning resources for developers to learn how to write better code and how to write helpful code reviews.</p>
    <h2>Our Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>Coming soon, but basically, we expect people to be helpful and respectful of all participants, regardless of skill level.</p>
    <p>Also, no discriminatory behaviour of any sort will be tolerated.</p>
